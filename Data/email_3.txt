Hi there, Doreen

Long time no see. Hope all's well in your world!

I haven't been to JALT all year, shame on me, but I needed the break.
I still see the guys and I'm going to the national, so don't write me off
yet!

I was trying to remember who you've published with in the past, and I
wondered if you had any contacts at Nan'Un-Do. I want to send a
proposal to them but have no names, and the personal touch is always
best!

I might go to see Jane Willis, family commitments permitting, any plans in
that direction? Going to Shizuoka I presume?

Bye for now
All the best
