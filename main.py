Thanks for the e-mail.ã€€ It is always nice to hear from people, especially
from you, Scott.

I have not got any reply, a positive or negative one, from Seibido yet.
Let's wait and hope that it will make a BOOK.

Have you finished your paperwork for Kaken and writing academic articles?
If you have some free time in the near future, I want to meet you and
explain to you our next project.

Why not drink out in Hiroshima if we are accepted?
We need to celebrate ourselves, don't we?
Let's have a small end-of-the-year party!

Sincerely, K. Nakagawa'''))
